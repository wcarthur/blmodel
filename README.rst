A linear model of the tropical cyclone boundary layer
=====================================================

This code represents an analytical linear model of the tropical
cyclone boundary layer, based on Kepert, J. D.: "The Dynamics of
Boundary Layer Jets within the Tropical Cyclone Core. Part I: Linear
Theory", 2001, *Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences*, **58**,
p2469--2484. 

The original code remains copyright Commonwealth of Australia (Bureau
